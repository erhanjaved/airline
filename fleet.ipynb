    "### Notes\n",
    "- did not include demand in this model because that seems like more of a revenue thing? it also might make this a bit too complicated\n",
    "- not sure about some of the code for the constraints, need to check on this\n",
    "- used the logic from the Ozdemir paper on fleet assignment\n",
    "- this seems like a VERY large scope if we plan to include connecting flights + route selection inside the model+code. Maybe it is enough to just talk about it in the discussion to give recommednations for most profitable/lowest costing routes?\n",
    "- should probably add food+water costs, will do this in a bit"
